BfA update for Healium addon

To install:
1. Click the green 'Clone or download' button
2. Download the .zip.
3. Extract the .zip to a folder. This will be called 'Healium-master' by default.
4. Go to folder to your World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns and move the existing Healium folder somewhere else to keep as a backup copy.
6. Back in your Healium-master folder, there is a Healium folder. This is the folder you should copy over to your Addons folder.
7. Launch the game

Please do file and bug reports or feature requests, and I'll take a look at them! When you do, please be as specific as possible and include screenshots if you're able. I don't actively use Healium myself, so I'm not as familiar with some of its intricacies or functionality as you guys who use it day to day. I'm happy to try to make fixes or improvements, but any help you can lend me is greatly appreciated.
